These app are currently broken!

Unfortunately I don't have the time to fix them. The issues are probably a change in [crossdomain.xml](http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Flash) and schema changes in Freebase.

* VentureSpin - a graphical browser of venture-funded companies.
* CineSpin - for films, actors and directors.
* FilmSpin - similar to CineSpin?
* FreeSpin - generic Freebase graph connection viewer

And also:

* SoundLine - Timeline view of musical artists and albums by decade and genre.
* QueryEditor - an incomplete query editor for Freebase. It would take a lot of work to better the [current Query Editor](http://www.freebase.com/app/queryeditor).
